    A Teresi Christmas tradition.
    Runza is a yeasted dough pocket filled with beef, cabbage, and plenty of pepper.
    Straight from Leah Scheck (Oma's aunt) and Mary Katherine Steinmiller (Oma's grandma).
    It is a German / Russian dish that is a specialty of Nebraska, where my mother's side of the family are from.
