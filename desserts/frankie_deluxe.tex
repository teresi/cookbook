\begin{preparation}
\item Bring eggs \& butter to room temperature.

\item Melt the chocolate.
	Add it to a small bowl, microwave $\approx 15$ \second, stir, repeat until melted.
	Set aside to cool.

\item Mix dry ingredients except the sugar in a large bowl.

\item Cream on medium high the butter, brown sugar, white sugar.
	Add eggs, vanilla, mix well.
	Add chocolate slowly while mixing.

\item Gradually beat in the dry ingredients on low until combined.

\item Chill dough in the mixing bowl for 10 \minute.
	Preheat oven to 350 \Fahrenheit.
	Unwrap peppermint patties.
	Grease two cookie sheets.

\item Assemble the cookies in batches.
	Scoop out two tablespoons, flatten out, and sandwich around a peppermint pattie.
	Pinch the dough on the permiter to close and roll to shape.
	Arrange on a cookie sheet.

\item Move the cookie sheet to the fridge for $\approx 10$ \minute.
	Bake for $\approx 10$ \minute, or until edges are set.
	The center should still be mostly soft and will set as it cools.
	Transfer to a wire rack when it solidifies.

\end{preparation}

\begin{variation}
\item Try replacing the peppermint pattie with chocolate chips.
\end{variation}


\begin{experiments}
\item The chill time significantly affects the spread.
	\citeauthor{sallyBrownies2020} \cite{sallyBrownies2020} recommends 20 \minute, but recommends 15 \minute~out on the counter if it cools too much.
	Here we need the dough to be less firm to shape.
	These instructions may need further modifications so that each batch is consistent after the first chill of the dough.
