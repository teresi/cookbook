\begin{preparation}
\item Cut fat into small pieces ($\approx 3/8"$ cubes), place in freezer briefly along with water until cold.

\item Mix flour, sugar, salt, butter, in a large bowl.
	Blend using a pastry cutter $\|$ fork $\|$ fingers, until the butter is pea sized.
	Blend the shortening similarly.

\item Add half the water and toss with fork.
	Add water $\approx 1.5 \dots 2$ \Tablespoon~at a time, and pull all the flour into the dough.
	Continue until the dough can be packed together.

\item Pack dough into a ball, knead once or twice.
	Flatten onto a floured surface into $\approx 3/4"$ disks.
	Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 \hour~or overnight.

\item Roll pastry onto wax paper, invert onto pie pan \& shape.
	Freeze for 15 \minute.

\item For a pre-baked crust: preheat to 400 \Fahrenheit, press aluminum foil on top of pastry and fill with pie weights.
	Bake 15 \minute, remove foil \& weights, prick holes into pastry base with fork to prevent bubbles.

\item Lower to 375 \Fahrenheit, bake $10 \dots 12$ \minute~for a partially pre-baked crust or $15 \dots 17$ \minute~for a fully prebaked crust.
