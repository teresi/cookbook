\hint{
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a lot of liquid in this pie, so use a deep pan and a high crust. Bake over a cookie sheet to catch spills in the second bake. This was modified with more tapioca ($1/4 C \rightarrow 1/2C$) to mitigate liquid after cooling; feel free to experiment.
\item The flavor doesn't need any modifications but cardamom works well.
\item Don't eat the rhubarb leaves.
\end{itemize}
