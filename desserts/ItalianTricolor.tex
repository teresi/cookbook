\preparation{
\step Preheat oven ($350F^\circ$), grease three $8"\;x\;8"$ (square) pans.
Line bottoms w/ waxed paper, grease and flour paper.

\step In large bowl w/ mixer at medium-high speed, blend: almond paste, butter, sugar, almond extract.
There will be small lumps remaining.
Reduce to medium and add eggs one-at-a-time.
Reduce to low and beat in flour \& salt until just combined.

\step Divide batter into thirds into separate bowls.
Blend green dye into one, red into another, leaving one un-tinted.
\step For each mixture, transfer into prepared metal pan and spread evenly (e.g. with an offset spatula).

\step Bake on two oven racks $10-12\; minutes$ rotating pans between upper/lower racks halfway through.
Ensure layers are set such that a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

\step Cool in pans on wire racks $5\; minutes$.
Run knife around sides to loosen layers. Invert onto racks, leaving wax paper attached, and cool completely.

\step When layers are cool, use a food processor or sieve to remove large chunks from the fruit preserves.
Remove the waxed paper from the layers.
Assemble by inverting the layers and spreading the preserves in the following order: green, 1/2 of the preserves, white, 1/2 of the preserves, red.
Heat the chocolate and shortening on low in a 1-quart saucepan, stirring frequently until melted.
Spread on top of the red layer, but not the sides, and refrigerate at least 1 hour.

\step To serve, let rest at room temperature for at least 5 minutes then trim the edges and cut into squares (about 36 pieces).
Store cookies in a single layer in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 3 months.

\hint{
\begin{itemize}
\item Use fresh almond paste, try dark chocolate, try adding liqueur to the fruit, try adding zest in the cake layer.
\item Reduce cracking in chocolate by increasing shortening or adding corn syrup or raising temperature.
\item Try other combinations of colors and preserves for different events, such as red/white/blue with cherries for $4^{th}$ of July, and orange/white/black for Halloween.
\item A double batch may prevent breaking and make it easier to spread in the pan.
