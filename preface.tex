Welcome to the Teresi family cookbook.
This is a curated list of recipes from family, friends, and other sources.
Consider it an invitation for collaboration.

This is designed as an ongoing project.
It's written in \LaTeX\ to separate content from presentation and versioned in \texttt{Git} to track changes over a long period of time.

Said presentation is included below, see \texttt{recipe\_snippet.tex}.
Future changes to the layout will affect all recipes through the use of environments / commands provided there.
