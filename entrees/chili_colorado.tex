	\preparation{
		\step Measure the spices, chop the sage, and crush the garlic.
		\step Prepare the pork. Cut into $\approx1\;inch$ cubes, toss with salt, pepper.
		\step Brown the pork. Heat a neutral oil almost to smoking point in a $ \geqq 3.5\;quart$ pot. Reduce to medium high. Brown in batches so as to not overcrowd, de-glazing if necessary to prevent burning.
		\step Add spices, stir for about a minute.
		\step Add $5\;Cups$ stock, simmer uncovered for $1hour$.
		\step Meanwhile,re-hydrate the chilies. Remove stems, seeds, veins from chilies and roughly chop. Add to large bowl, add $3\;Cups$ boiling stock, cover with plastic wrap. Wait $30\;minutes$, then blend it all.
		\step Add blended chilies to the soup at the end of the first simmer. Simmer for $45\;minutes$ uncovered.
		\step Season with salt pepper to taste.

	\hint{
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "Chili Colorado" means "chili colored red" rather than from the state of Colorado.
			\item Toss pork with a bit of flour as well to thicken the chili further.
			\item Marjoram can be a substitute for the Mexican oregano if necessary, but not Mediterranean oregano.
			\item Serve with tortillas, and the carrots from 'Mexican Beef Bowl' \ref{mexican_beef_bowl}. Rick Martinez recommends rice, beans a la charra, and tortillas.
