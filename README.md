# COOKBOOK

Teresi family cookbook.


## CONTRIBUTING

- add recipes as individual tex files using a `recipe` (i.e. \begin{recipe...\end{recipe})
  - add to a folder with the same name as the section
  - append the graphics path as appropriate
- include the recipe in the appropriate section in the main doc (`/cookbook.tex')


## DESIGN

- using `xcookybooky` for formatting
- using top level document (`cookbook.tex`) with included files (`\include{myrecipe}`)


## STYLE

- add recipes as a one page instruction set and one page image
- use a minimalistic voice in the instruction set (the preparation block)
- add 'hints' for recipe modifications / variations


## FUTURE

- [ ] add hints to the margins
- [ ] modify 'Ingredients' blocks to three columns (amount, unit, ingredient)
- [ ] add cover
- [ ] add image collage to start of sections
- [ ] add bibliography
