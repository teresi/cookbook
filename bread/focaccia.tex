{Focaccia}

\ingredients {
\unit[500]{g} & bread flour\\
\unit[10]{g} & salt\\
\unit[10]{g} & yeast, instant\\
\unit[140]{ml} & olive oil\\
\unit[360]{ml} & water
}

\preparation
{

\step Mix the dough.
Add flour to mixing bowl, add salt \& yeast on opposite sides.
Add $40ml$ oil \& $\approx 3/4$ water, hand mix.
Continue mixing and gradually add water until all the flour is incorporated; water may be left over.
Aim for a soft / wet dough.

\step Knead the dough.
Add some oil to the working surface.
Add dough to surface, knead $\approx 5...10\;min$.
Knead past the wet stage until the exterior is smooth \& soft.
Refrain from adding more flour.

\step Rise the dough.
Move dough to a lightly oiled $\approx 2..3\; quart$ tub.
Add tea towel on top and rise $\approx 1\;hr$ until at least doubled in size.

\step Separate the dough.
Line baking parchment to two trays, drizzle olive oil on top.
Add olive oil to the working surface, optionally dust w/ fine semolina.
Move dough to working surface slowly as to keep air in the dough.
Divide dough in half and stretch out flat onto the trays.

\step Prove the dough.
Add each tray into a plastic bag and prove for $\approx 1 hr$, until it has doubled in size.
The dough should spring back quickly.
Preheat oven to $430^\circ \; F$.

\step Bake.
Add dimples on top of the dough using your fingers; push all the way to the bottom.
Drizzle each with olive oil, top with flaked salt and oregano.
Bake $\approx 15 \; min$.
The bread should be cooked through so that tapping the bottom will sound hollow.
Drizzle with olive oil, cool.
